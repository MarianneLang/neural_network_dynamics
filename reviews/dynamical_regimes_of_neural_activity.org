#+title: Dynamical Regimes of Thalamocortical Activity: Insights from Theoretical Models of Spiking Networks
#+author: Y.Zerlaut

** Abstract

We review here the 

** Dynamical Regimes in Spiking Networks

*** Rhythmic versus


*** Asynchronous Activity

*** Sources of Synchrony

- Finite size effects

- 

**** Weak synchrony: fast oscillation

**** Strong synchrony: slow rhythm, finite size effects 

***** Strong synchrony: slow rhythm



** Regimes of Wakefulness

** Regimes of Slow Wave Activity
