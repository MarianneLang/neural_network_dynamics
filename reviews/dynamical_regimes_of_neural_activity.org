** Abstract

We review here the

*** Synchrony, Regularity and Rhythmicity of Spiking Activity in Neural Networks

A seminal study introduced synchrony and regularity  (Brunel, 2000)

- Regularity: property of a single neuron spiking over time
- Synchrony: property of pairwise interaction to simultaneously fire together
- rhythmicity: population 




Here, we complement this classification by adding another dimension: the rhythmicity. Indeed, network activity can

*** Asynchronous Activity

*** Sources of Synchrony

- Finite-Size Effects & Clustering

- Stochastic Transitions in 

*** Sources of Rhytmicity

- Pacemaker-like biophysical mechanisms

- Network 

**** Weak synchrony: fast oscillation

**** Strong synchrony: slow rhythm, finite size effects 

***** Strong synchrony: slow rhythm


** Experimental Characterization of Thalamocortical Dynamics

*** Intracellular recordings

Because a cortical neuron receives inputs from underds to thousands of
its neighbors, the intracellular dynamics offers an particular readout
of

*** Extracellular recordings

*** Perturbations 1: sensory stimuli

*** Perturbations 2: Electrical and optogenetic stimulation
