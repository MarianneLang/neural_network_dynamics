# Neural network dynamics

*Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations of the emergent dynamics in spiking neural networks*

Network simulations toolkit built as a layer on top of the [brian2 simulator](https://brian2.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).


## Aim 

- mean-field predictions of network dynamics
- numerical simulations of Adexp models of arbitrary population number and connectivity matrices with flexible intrinsic currents
- cellular dynamics simulations
- 

## Installation

Using =git= to clone the repository and "pip" to install the package in your python environment:

```
git clone https://github.com/yzerlaut/neural_network_dynamics.git
pip install -r neural_network_dynamics/requirements.txt
```
